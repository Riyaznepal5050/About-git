Here in Nepal there is dowry system, in this system we have to pay money or dowry to boys(grooms). If we will not pay them then they will not marry . I am very helpless because I am a minor Herbal doctor and I am running a small clinic for me and my families livelihood. I have no money for dowry and marriages that's why I am requesting to you for helping me with money.
I need 12 Lakh rupees for my both sisters marriage. If you please help me. I will be very grateful to you.And Allah will bless you.
Thank you.
